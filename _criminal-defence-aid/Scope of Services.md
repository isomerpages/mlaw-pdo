The Public Defender’s Office provides legal representation to individuals who cannot afford to engage a lawyer and are charged with most types of criminal offences.

#### What type of criminal proceedings are not handled by the Public Defender’s Office?

The Public Defender's Office will **not** handle criminal proceedings relating to:

a.     Offences punishable by death;

b.     Offences that are regulatory in nature (for e.g., traffic summons) and departmental charges;

c.     Offences under 10 Acts relating to gambling, organised and syndicate crime, and terrorism;

d.    Offences prosecuted by private person 

Please refer to the Schedule under the Public Defender’s Act 2022 (click [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Bills-Supp/17-2022/Published/20220704?DocDate=20220704))for more information on the prescribed list of excluded offences and excluded class of offences.
	
The Public Defender’s Office will assess applications for criminal defence aid, including conducting a means test to assess the financial circumstances and merits test to assess whether there are reasonable grounds of the case. Eligible applications would be granted criminal defence aid and assigned to a Public Defender, who will then represent the accused person.

Eligible applications may also be referred to the Pro Bono SG, and a volunteer private lawyer would be assigned to represent the accused person.

An eligible accused person will **not** get to choose between the Public Defender or a volunteer private lawyer.
