The Public Defender’s Office will assess applications for criminal defence aid, including conducting a means test to assess the financial circumstances and merits test to assess whether there are reasonable grounds of the case. Eligible applications would be granted criminal defence aid and assigned to a Public Defender, who will then represent the accused person.

Eligible applications may also be referred to the Pro Bono SG, and a volunteer private lawyer would be assigned to represent the accused person.

An eligible accused person will not get to choose between the Public Defender or a volunteer private lawyer.
