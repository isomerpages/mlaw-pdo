are prohibited from entering the casinos, jackpot machine rooms and accessing
their Singapore Pools online betting accounts under section 165A of the
Casino Control Act 2006.</p>
<p>With effect from 1 April 2024, this Exclusion by Law will be extended
to individuals receiving Government-funded criminal defence aid from either
the Public Defender’s Office or under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme administered
by Pro Bono SG.</p>
<p>This means that for the period in which you are receiving criminal defence
aid, you will be banned from:</p>
<p>a. entering, remaining, or taking part in any gaming on all casino premises;</p>
<p>b. entering, remaining, or taking part in any gaming in all jackpot machine
rooms in private clubs (except for work<sup>1</sup> purposes); and</p>
<p>c. accessing Singapore Pools accounts-related services if you are an existing
account holder, or opening an account if you are not an existing account
holder.</p>
<p>When your case has concluded in Court or when you are no longer receiving
criminal defence aid, this Exclusion by Law will be revoked automatically
within 2 weeks.</p>
