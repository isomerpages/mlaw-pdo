#### What happens if I am unable to pay the contribution amount?

Please call **1800-225-5529** if you cannot meet the payment deadline and need more time to pay.

You may also request for a waiver, reduction of contribution amount or to pay in instalments. This request is however, assessed on a case-by-case basis.

#### I am under 21 years old. Can I apply for criminal defence aid with the Public Defender’s Office?

Your parent or legal guardian will have to submit the application on your behalf, if you are under 21 years old. If your parent or legal guardian is applying in-person at the MinLaw Service Centre or State Courts HELP Centre, it is recommended that you accompany your parent or legal guardian as you may be asked questions relating to your criminal proceedings. Alternatively, you may ask your parent or legal guardian to submit an online application.

If you do not have a parent or legal guardian, you will need to ask an appropriate adult to make the application on your behalf as a guardian. This adult should be someone you live with, such as an extended relative.

#### I am a foreigner. Can I apply for criminal defence aid with the Public Defender’s Office?

Public Defender’s Office is unable to assist foreigners.

For foreigners who require criminal legal aid, you may apply directly with Pro Bono SG (previously known as “Law Society Pro Bono Services”) which administers the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”).  More details can be found on their website [Pro Bono SG's Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS)](https://www.probono.sg/get-legal-help/legal-representation/) .
