<h3>How can I get help from the Public Defender’s Office?</h3>
<p>The Public Defender’s Office will assess applications for criminal defence
aid, including conducting a means test to assess the financial circumstances
and merits test to assess whether there are reasonable grounds of the case.
Eligible applications would be granted criminal defence aid and assigned
to a Public Defender, who will then represent the accused person.</p>
<p>Eligible applications may also be referred to the Pro Bono SG, and a volunteer
private lawyer would be assigned to represent the accused person.</p>

the Public Defender or a volunteer private lawyer.</p>
