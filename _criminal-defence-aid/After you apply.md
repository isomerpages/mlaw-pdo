We can only assess your application when you have submitted all the required documents. 

To assess your application, you will need to undergo two interviews:

(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; **Means Test Interview** – determine if you have limited financial means to afford legal representation

(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; **Merits Test Interview** – determine if you have reasonable grounds for bringing or defending a case in Court

During the interviews, we may ask you to provide further information or documentation to assess your financial circumstances, or to understand your legal case better.

You will be informed of your interview date/time, and you must ensure you are available during the scheduled timing. The interviews will be conducted over the telephone. If you require accommodation (e.g., sign language interpreter etc), please inform us when you submit your application.

If your application is successful, you will receive an email with your application outcome. You may be required to pay a contribution amount to the Public Defender’s Office before the Grant of Aid is given and a Public Defender is assigned to your case. Payment must be made within the deadline given, failing which the grant of aid will not be issued to you.

Eligible cases for criminal defence aid may also be referred to Pro Bono SG. If your application is referred to Pro Bono SG, you will be required to pay a contribution amount to them before a volunteer lawyer is assigned to your case.

The quantum of your contribution amount is based on the assessment of your means. You can make the payment via our eCollection Portal (click [here](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/ecoll/index)). The available payment modes are PayNow, eNets, Visa/Mastercard.
