The scales of justice that straddles the two doors symbolise truth and fairness, while the opening doors signify access to justice regardless of means. 

Blue represents integrity, service and excellence. It signifies an unwavering commitment to serve the public with dependability and trust.

Red represents justice, passion and determination. It is symbolic of a fervent pursuit of justice in a fair and compassionate manner.

Together, the logo encapsulates the work of the Public Defender’s Office, to provide  quality legal representation to vulnerable members of our society through criminal defence aid, thereby enhancing access to justice.
