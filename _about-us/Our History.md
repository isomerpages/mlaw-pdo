In 1956, the Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance was passed. It aimed to deliver free civil legal aid to deserving cases. The Ordinance also contained provisions on criminal legal aid. But the latter provisions were not brought into force. That remained the position when the Legal Aid and Advice Act was passed in 1995.

In September 1985, the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) was founded for non-capital cases.

In September 2007, the Law Society of Singapore took over the administration of CLAS through its charitable arm, the Pro Bono Services Office which is also known as Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS). The Government started funding criminal legal aid indirectly by providing support for LSPBS.

In 2018 and 2019, the Government began comprehensive review of criminal legal aid in Singapore.

On 4 April 2022- Government formally announced the establishment of the Public defenderâ€™s Office (PDO) as a department under Ministry of law. this would be fully funded by the government and staffed by full time public defenders.
