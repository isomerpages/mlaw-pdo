**History of criminal defence aid**

**1956:**

The Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance was passed to provide free civil legal aid to deserving cases. While the Ordinance contained provisions on criminal defence aid, these provisions did not come into force. 

**1985: Start of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS)**

The Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) was set up as a ground-up scheme to provide criminal defence aid to vulnerable persons facing non-capital charges in Singapore and cannot afford a lawyer. The scheme was privately funded by the Law Society of Singapore and goodwill donations, while volunteer lawyers provided legal representation.

**2007: Administration of CLAS**

The Pro Bono SG (formerly known as the Law Society Pro Bono Services) took over the administration of CLAS. The Government also started funding criminal defence aid indirectly by providing funding support for their pro bono work.

**2013: Government announces intention to start funding criminal legal aid**

The Government announced intention to directly fund CLAS, and the set-up of a Criminal Legal Aid Steering Committee (CLAS SC), chaired by a High Court judge and comprising representatives from Law Society, the Criminal Bar, Singapore Academy of Law, Ministry of Law. The CLAS SC was also tasked with formulating the framework for an enhanced CLAS, in consultation with the Criminal Bar, to ensure that such aid was given to deserving cases.

**2015: Direct Government Funding of the Enhanced CLAS**

Law firms stepped forward in support of pro bono efforts, with 22 law firms signing Memorandums-of-Understanding to pledge the taking on of 300 pro bono criminal cases yearly. The CLAS Fellowship was established with law firms sponsoring or seconding full-time lawyers to work exclusively on CLAS cases.
The Government begins co-funding CLAS.  Enhancements to the scheme were introduced to increase the scope of assistance provided, including broadening the means test criterion to allow more applicants to qualify for legal aid, and the introduction of honoraria to recognise the contribution of volunteers who take on CLAS cases. 

From 2015 to 2021, an average of more than 1,200 persons received support each year from CLAS, a three-fold increase from pre-2015. 

**2018- 2020: Review of the Enhanced CLAS**

The Government began a comprehensive review of Singapore’s criminal aid model. In 2020, the Ministry of Law announced that the Government was considering the feasibility of a Public Defender’s Scheme.

**2022: Ministerial Statement on the Establishment of a Public Defender’s Office**

On 4 April 2022, the Ministry of Law announced its plans to establish the Public Defender’s Office (PDO) as a department under the Ministry of Law by the end of 2022 to enhance access to justice for vulnerable persons in Singapore. There were also plans to expand income coverage and widen the scope of offences coverage.  

The Public Defenders Act was passed by Parliament on 1 August 2022 and assented to by the President on 19 August 2022.

On 01 December 2022, the PDO commenced its operations.
