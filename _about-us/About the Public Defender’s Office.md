The Public Defender Office ("PDO") is a department established under the Ministry of Law on  to provide high-quality legal assistance and representation to individuals who are facing non-capital criminal charges in Singapore but are unable to engage a lawyer due to limited means.

We are headed by a Chief Public Defender and staffed by Public Defenders, responsible for carrying out the Public Defenders Act 2022 and the administration of the Public Defender’s Office.

The PDO co-delivers criminal legal aid alongside the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“**CLAS**”) which is administered by Law Society Pro Bono Service ("LSPBS").
