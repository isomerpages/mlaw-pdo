The Public Defender’s Office (PDO) is established to enhance access to justice to vulnerable persons through the provision of criminal defence aid.

Set-up as a department under the Ministry of Law, the PDO will be staffed by full-time officers who are responsible for assisting the Chief Public Defender in carrying out his functions under the Public Defenders Act 2022.
