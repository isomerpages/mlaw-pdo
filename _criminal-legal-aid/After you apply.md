**1. What Happens After My Application is Approved?**

PDO will assign a volunteer lawyer who will handle your case. You will be informed of the particulars of the lawyer by email. You will then be his/her client.

If you discharge the counsel assigned by PDO, you will be required to reimburse PDO for the expenses incurred on your behalf, including but not limited to the costs of medical reports that have been paid for by PDO on your behalf. No new counsel will be assigned to you in the event of a discharge. 

Applicants who are found to have the financial ability to engage their own private counsel subsequent to PDO approval will be investigated and dealt with seriously.


**2. My Spouse/ My Child Under 21 Years Old Has Applied for Legal Aid from Remand. What Should I Do?**

If the applicant is in remand, and you are the:

•	Spouse of the applicant, or;

•	Parent of the single minor applicant under 21 years old;

You will also need to complete the PDO APPLICATION FORM after your spouse/child has been interviewed. You will receive an email from us setting out the next steps and the submission of documents after we have reviewed your application.

**3.How Long Would It Take for Me to Get a Lawyer from PDO?**

If you qualify completely for legal aid, it may take up to 3 months for a lawyer to be assigned to you. If your application is rejected or co-payment is required, you should be notified in about 2 weeks from the date your application is accepted for processing. If co-payment is required, the above 3-month timeline estimate will start from the date that co-payment is made in full.

**4. Co-payment for Criminal Legal Aid**

If your application for criminal legal aid is successful, you may be required to make one (1) or more financial contributions (either in a lump sum or by instalments, and by any time specified by the Chief Public Defender) to the Public Defender’s Office before a lawyer is assigned to you. 

The financial contribution amount which you will need to pay is dependent on your income and assets, and will be made known to you when you are informed of the outcome of the application.
