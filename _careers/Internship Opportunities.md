#### Objective

An internship is a learning experience for aspiring lawyers to experience what the job offers and demands. This 3-week programme will introduce interns to the role of the Public Defenderâ€™s Office (PDO), and allow interns to experience the work of a Public Defender and how a Public Defender can make a difference. Interns can expect to work alongside the Public Defenders and attend court proceedings, client meetings, conduct research and prepare documents. 

Besides having a chance to observe ongoing criminal proceedings, interns will also be exposed to the internal deliberations in the PDO, such as merits assessments and case strategy discussions. To enrich their internship programme and ensure a fruitful experience, interns will be assigned to designated Public Defenders as supervising mentors. 


#### Eligibility

Application for the July 2023 internship intake has closed. Any future openings or opportunities will be made known accordingly.
