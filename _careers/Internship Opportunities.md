<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>Public Defenders make a difference. This 3-week programme will introduce
interns to the Public Defenderâ€™s Office (PDO) and allow interns to experience
the work of a Public Defender. Interns can expect to work alongside the
Public Defenders and attend court proceedings, client meetings, conduct
research and prepare documents.</p>
<p>Aside from ongoing criminal proceedings, interns will be exposed to the
deliberations within the PDO, such as merits assessments and case strategy
discussions. To enrich their internship programme and ensure a fruitful
experience, interns will be assigned to designated Public Defenders as
supervising mentors.</p>
