#### Objective

Public Defenders make a difference. This 3-week programme will introduce interns to the Public Defender’s Office (PDO) and allow interns to experience the work of a Public Defender. Interns can expect to work alongside the Public Defenders and attend court proceedings, client meetings, conduct research and prepare documents.

Aside from ongoing criminal proceedings, interns will be exposed to the deliberations within the PDO, such as merits assessments and case strategy discussions. To enrich their internship programme and ensure a fruitful experience, interns will be assigned to designated Public Defenders as supervising mentors.
